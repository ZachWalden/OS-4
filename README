PURPOSE OF PROJECT
##################

This script emulates page replacement. There are multiple algorithms for this, and we are
implementing 3 for this assignment: FIFO, LRU, & Optimal. Optimal will always be better then
the two former: FIFO will have many faults, and LRU will often beat FIFO assuming a realistic
page frame table. However, optimal allows a more versatile apporach in comparison.
